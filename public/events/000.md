# MSMC Transport Carrier // 2.21.5014u
Our crew awakens from their month-long stasis and set their sights on the recently-rediscovered planetoid known as **HERCYNIA**, The drop carrier's captain notifies them to suit up - and make sure to borrow some EVA gear if they don't have any. The squad straps into one of a few dropships, and preps for the descent.

The squad is given a briefing packet from **LANDMARK COLONIAL** with the following sitrep: 

It also mentions that the **MSMC** are subcontracted from **UNION**, so the operation is under finer scrutiny than usual.

1. **UNION** has taken an interest, so this operation is under finer scrutiny than usual. Communications from **UNION** dictate that the squad treat the situation with utmost care. Hercynia is potentially populated by some sort of indigenous human culture, but the evidence is unclear. Remember that as members of a Landmark CRT, you answer to internal disciple first, local law second, and **UNION** justice third.
2. The Squad is to make contact with Landmark’s representative on the ground first in order to present their credentials and integrate into the local hierarchy.
3. Hercynia was once subject to a widespread and catastrophic SecComm expeditionary campaign. The records lack detail, but building from what has been recovered from the old Union Colonial Mission indicates that the Second Committee mounted a handful of similar campaigns against resistant populations. This likely accounts for the massive amount of radiation, distress signals, encrypted comms, and general “noise” coming off the world. The squad should expect to encounter old Union military infrastructure in the form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and possibly even abandoned ground-based installations.

You have several corporate-approved objectives:
1. Secure the colony's NHP casket and any backups.
2. Secure essential personnel and equipment.
3. Ensure accurate data collection.

All other costs and casualties can be recouped.
Other instructions will be patched through your Comp/con units by your off-site commanding officer **COMPADRE**, alongside legal consultant/executive officer **SNAKEMAN**

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **BRAVA HADURA** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.

The squad is escorted to **EVERGREEN** by the militia members. As they walk through the rainy streets, all eyes are on them; the off-worlders said to be here to save the colony from its attackers.

At a crossroads, the squad is warned that the street is a favorite of the sniper that has been plaguing the people of **EVERGREEN**, they are warned to move fast. The sniper takes a shot at **SOVEREIGN**, but does no harm. 

Rather than settle in, the squad is ushered to the **GOVERNOR'S FARM** for a meeting with **PATIENCE**, the colony's administrative NHP.
