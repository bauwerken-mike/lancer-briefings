# Landmark colony EVERGREEN // 5014u
Time passes, and **PATIENCE** calls in a meeting to discuss a potential attack on the colony by the **HUC**. The team elects to attempt a peaceful resolution with the natives, going against orders by freeing Rodriche and giving him his disarmed mech back as a sign of good faith, allowing him to negotiate in their stead for a ceasefire. Unfortunately, it seems the more radical elemements of the **HUC** have already begun their assault on **EVERGREEN'S** reactor, seeking to cripple the power source of the entire colony. The Corps desperately rushes back home, since only **CORNFLAKE** remains to defend the colony.
