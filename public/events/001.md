# Landmark colony EVERGREEN // 2.21.5014u
During the meeting **PATIENCE** described the situation surrounding the attacks on **EVERGREEN** Colonists. Attacks have been occuring for a little over a year; mostly in the **GRAY TOWNS** and against travelling convoys, but attacks against **EVERGREEN** itself is not uncommon, as evidence by the active sniper threat outside the settlement.

Many militia members have been spreading stories that the attacks are being carried out by giant bugs. **EGREGORIANS**, giant, insect-like creatures that once inhabited **HERCYNIA**. **PATIENCE** dismisses these as scare tactics, and pulls up footage showing Human assailants using natural materials and chitinous covering to appear more insect-like in combat.

The squad is then provided two different urgent matters that could use their attention:

 - The sniper that is plaguing the colony needs to be taken care of, both for the safety of the colonists, as well as a potential lead of where these attacks are coming from.
 - **CHIEF ENGINEER CASTOR FIELDING** needs an armed escort to help bring supplies to **EVERGREEN'S** landing bowl so that the Engineering team can get to work repairing the sinkholes that have opened up. These repairs would allow larger ships to land at **EVERGREEN** and will help it's infrastructure and trade grow significantly.
In the end, both of these missions are very important, and on an urgent timescale.

The squad decides to take the fight to the sniper, and they are shown to the **PRINT SHOP** where they are able to begin printing their Mechs.

On the way out, the squad runs into **EDINA JI**, the right-hand woman to the Admin NHP and their Chief Advisor during their stay. She offered to escort them to the **PRINT SHOP**, were she asked the team to assist in data gathering operations during their time here. Upon arrival, Edina introduces the newly christened **CRT CHIMERA CORPS** to the Chief Engineer of the Colonial Engineering Corps, **CASTOR FIELDING**. Chief Felding warmly welcomes the added security, and mentions that data of enemy combat mechs could come in real handy to outfit them with proper weaponry. After checking out their lodgings at **THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL**, a popular local tavern, the Chimera Corps sets out to hunt a sniper.

Following the trail of a previous militia squad that attempted this mission, the Chimera Corps swiftly tracks the nearly wiped squad memebers and applies expert first aid. Finding more tracks, they quickly find themselves lured into an ambush by their enemy, seeming to be humanoid insects. Beset on all sides, the Corps makes quick work of most (revealed to be human) enemies, despite a few rounds of bad luck. This evens out when the enemy leader, the strange unidentified 'Strider' mech known as **VENOM**, is struck in a critical part and collapses under its own weight. While one of his allies fled the battle with their life, the pilot of the Strider is taken into custody, mech and all. While proper interrogation will have to wait until all calms down, the stranger seems to speak a dialect of Union Standard unfamiliar to anyone present. 

The Chimera Corps returns to Evergreen to deliver their new cargo and assist Chief Feilding with his own mission.

After a hard fight defending the engineering crew against a raider ambush, **CHIMERA CORPS** rushes to their next objective as **PATIENCE** patches a distress signal through from one of the **GRAY TOWNS** to the east, unofficial settlements that exist outside landmark law. Responding swiftly, and after a brief stop by the **PURPLE HAND SQUAD** a local mercenary team hired to defend the town roads, the team finds an exodus of subalterns heading to an unknown point further east. Investigations stall when an unknown mech broadcasts blasts of orders on old **UNION** channels, and assaults the farm of **ALBERT CHAU** with an army of subalterns. **THE BROADCAST**, after claiming to BE **UNION** is swiftly put out of commission and its remains brought back to base, with the grateful farmers relocating elsewhere.

Returning to **EVERGREEN** victorious, the corps begins their investigations over the next few weeks of spring. **SOVEREIGN** and **GALAHAD** lead an excavation effort that unearths an old proto-mech frame that is repurposed for use in the scouting efforts of **FOREST FIRE**, who finds the exodus of subalterns heading east gathering below one of our radio transmitters. **NURGLE** investigates the history of **HERCYNIA**, discovering rumours that the planet was host to a great conflict that served as the testing ground for mech frames during the **SECCOMM** era, with possible nuclear weapons and **TOTAL BIOME KILL** weaponry having been used to render the planet uninhabitable for centuries. 

This informations fits with the interrogation of the **VENOM** pilot. After a lengthy interrogation, the pilot **RODRICHE KIMERO** claims to be part of the **HERCYNIAN UNITED CITIES**, an indigenous population that has lived on this planet for 5 centuries. His people have assaulted **EVERGREEN** under the belief they are the same people who came here to commit 'The Great Crime' so long ago, which involved the eradication of the "First People".
