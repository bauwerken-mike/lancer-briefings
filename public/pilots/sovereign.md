Born in the outer rim baronies Septima is a product of unrivalled chauvinism and technology.

Created in a batch of ten clone siblings, Septima and her siblings were created with a specific purpose in mind. They had been genetically engineered to be superior to most at their delegated task. While Septima’s six brothers were created to be rulers and knights her sisters were made as perfect and beautiful pawns. Chess pieces to be moved around and leveraged for power.

Septima’s response was a swift middle finger and a well-timed gas leak.

She took her sisters and fled to Union space. With not a single Manna to their name, Septima joined the Union’s military. She took to it well, quickly climbing the ranks to become a Master Sergeant before being offered a place in the Lancer program.

Not wanting to be called ’Princess’ by every yokel from core to cradle, Septima adopted the callsign Sovereign.

After two tours of duty she moved over to private security and joined Landmark.
